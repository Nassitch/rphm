- In the near future, the library will be compatible with all front-end applications.

# Installation & Usage

<h3>

1. Installation of the package on your Angular project.

```

```

2. Script execution for install & update.

```
npm run rphm
```

# Description.

This library promotes atomic design, which involves breaking down user interfaces into elementary components called atoms, molecules, organisms, etc..

This approach fosters code reusability, consistency, and maintainability. The design system file provides the necessary basic elements for building these atoms and their associated components by defining their structure and style.

However, when assembling website pages, it may be necessary to adjust certain visual or functional aspects of the components without altering their basic structure. This is where the library comes into play: by providing a set of additional CSS classes, it allows for the rapid application of predefined styles for elements such as margins, spacing, positioning, etc.

The library and the design system work in synergy, offering a comprehensive and modular approach for frontend development, where the atoms defined in the design system serve as a solid foundation to which the library's classes add functionality and styles specific to the usage context.
